# Reconstructing Graphic Design Posters via Visual Decomposition and Semantic Layer Translation
### SIGGRAPH 2025

### Abstract
This work presents a pipeline to convert rasterized graphic design
posters into multi-layered, editable digital assets. It decomposes
the input poster into core elements, categorizes them, and converts
them into semantically meaningful formats. A novel strategy using
Z-index addresses layer ordering and overlap. The pipeline’s
accuracy was evaluated by comparing over 24,000 original and reconstructed
posters of multiple widely used sizes and aspect ratios
in print & digital media. Layer semantic accuracy was assessed
using the LLaVA-7B model, which showed high confidence scores
across image, text, and shape layers. A user-centered evaluation
with 20 participants resulted in high satisfaction ratings, confirming
the pipeline’s ability to accurately reproduce poster designs
with excellent fidelity, layout, and overall quality. This pipeline
contributes a refined approach to reconstructing rasterized graphic
design posters, advancing beyond existing methods.
